# Optimisation-modelling-data-mining-and-predictive-analytics

QUESTION 01. Management of Celtic Candles want you to help answering the question: how
many of each product should be made to maximize the profit? 

To answer the question, formulate and solve a linear optimisation model using
MS Excel Solver. Prepare a written report to the management containing details
of the model formulation, Solver dialog box, generated reports, and their
interpretation in a business context.

QUESTION 02. Task: Build a predictive model.

Having the bank dataset and based on your knowledge in business modelling and
analytics, you are required to:
• Using XLMiner, build a model that can predict if a customer will subscribe
for term deposit or not.
• Provide a report to the bank management, briefly outlining the process
of model development in the context of the CRISP-DM methodology. You
are to justify your model proposal and give arguments that would
convince the bank management that it is the model they are looking for.
You can also briefly explain how the selected modelling technique works
in order to provide the prediction required. Should you have any
additional findings or insights that you believe the bank management
should know, you can include them in your report.
